# Use Case Adoption

This repository contains the replication package for the case study on use case adoption.
The study aims to answer 

1. how use case descriptions are adopted for requirements specification at a large-scale company,
2. how the quality of these use case descriptions affects the subsequent software engineering process, and
3. how the requirements engineering process affects the quality of use case descriptions.

> [!CAUTION]
> This replication package does not contain any real data, as the data used in the case study is sensitive and cannot be shared. All data contained in this repository is **mocked** and only serves to make the scripts and code more usable.
